Using SVG foreignObject to show code coverage results.

The HTML below is created with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [gcov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcov) and some home brewed javascript.
Because it is an SVG image, the size of it must be set correctly. I have not tested if it looks OK if you change your screen resolution or you have a specific smartphone, tablet or browser.
