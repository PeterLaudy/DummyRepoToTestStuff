Using SVG foreignObject to show code coverage results.
------------------------------------------------------

The HTML below is created with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [gcov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcov) and some home brewed javascript.
The lines with a dark red background color where not executed and thus have no test coverage.
I have not tested if it looks OK if you change your screen resolution or have a specific smartphone, tablet or browser.
